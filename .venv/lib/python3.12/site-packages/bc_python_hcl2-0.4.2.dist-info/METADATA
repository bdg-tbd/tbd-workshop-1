# Notice

This is a fork of the [Python HCL2](https://github.com/amplify-education/python-hcl2) repo by Amplify and is 
officially supported by Bridgecrew. We contributed as much as possible to the upstream project, but the two projects 
are now deviating in a way that pushing new changes upstream doesn't make sense anymore.

## Python HCL2

A parser for [HCL2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/hclsyntax/spec.md) written in Python using
[Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). This parser only supports HCL2 and isn't backwards compatible
with HCL v1. It can be used to parse any HCL2 config file such as Terraform.

## About Amplify

country. We have a long history as the leading innovator in K-12 education - and have been described as the best tech 
company in education and the best education company in tech. While others try to shrink the learning experience into  
the technology, we use technology to expand what is possible in real classrooms with real students and teachers.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

python-hcl2 requires Python 3.7 or higher to run.

### Installing

This package can be installed using `pip`

```sh
pip install bc-python-hcl2
```

### Usage
```python
import hcl2
with open('foo.tf', 'r') as file:
    dict = hcl2.load(file)
```

## Building From Source

For development, `tox>=2.9.1` is recommended.

### Running Tests

python-hcl2 uses `tox`. You will need to install tox with `pip install tox`.
Running `tox` will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests.

You can also run them individually with the `-e` argument.

For example, `tox -e py37-unit` will run the unit tests for python 3.7

To see all the available options, run `tox -l`.
