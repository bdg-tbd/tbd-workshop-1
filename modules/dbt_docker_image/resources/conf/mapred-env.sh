# Specify the max heapsize for the JobHistoryServer.  If no units are
# given, it will be assumed to be in MB.
# This value will be overridden by an Xmx setting specified in HADOOP_OPTS,
# and/or MAPRED_HISTORYSERVER_OPTS.
# Default is the same as HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MAX.
#export HADOOP_JOB_HISTORYSERVER_HEAPSIZE=

# Specify the JVM options to be used when starting the HistoryServer.
# These options will be appended to the options specified as HADOOP_OPTS
# and therefore may override any similar flags set in HADOOP_OPTS

# Specify the log4j settings for the JobHistoryServer
# Java property: hadoop.root.logger
#export HADOOP_JHS_LOGGER=INFO,RFA
